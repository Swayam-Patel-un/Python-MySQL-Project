# 12th Grade Project: MySQL and Python Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of **Python** with **MySQL**, where I created a Python program to interact with and edit a MySQL database. It allows for seamless database operations through Python, showcasing how a front-end application can connect with a relational database.

## Key Features
- **Database Editing**: Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a MySQL database directly from the Python program.
- **Python-MySQL Connectivity**: Utilized the `mysql-connector-python` library to establish a connection between Python and the MySQL server.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Basic interface to run database operations from the terminal.
- **SQL Queries in Python**: Implemented SQL commands within Python for interacting with the MySQL database.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For the program logic and operations.
- **MySQL**: As the relational database system.
- **MySQL Connector for Python**: To enable Python-MySQL communication.

This project gave me valuable experience in database management, Python scripting, and SQL query execution, building a foundation for future work in database programming.
This was my 12th grade project on MySQL and Python, where I had made a python program to edit the MySQL database.
